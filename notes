--- gas optimization ---
read from memory instead of storage(copy the value from storage to memory if you'll use it often)
use custom errors

--- on storage ---
any variable that is changeable that we want to persist across the contract's executions and transactions is saved to a giant array called storage.
The array is sequentially indexed from zero
memory, constant and immutable variables don't go to storage
reading and writing to storage is expensive, so we want to minimize using storage as much as we can
